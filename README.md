# Forkify Project with TypeScript

This repository showcases my TypeScript implementation of the Forkify project from the Udemy JavaScript course. The app enables users to search, view, and manage cooking recipes with features like adjustable servings, bookmarking, and custom recipe uploads.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript Integration**: Refactored JavaScript codebase with strict type definitions.
- **MVC Architecture**: Organized code using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented Publisher-Subscriber pattern for cleaner event management.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Ensures bookmarked recipes are saved.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices.

## Course Sections Implemented

- Loading and Rendering Recipes from API
- Search Results with Pagination
- Updating Recipe Servings
- Bookmarks with LocalStorage
- Custom Recipe Uploads

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**
- **Parcel**
- **SCSS**
- **Forkify API**

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marioprskalo01/forkify-typescript-project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash

   ```

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests.
- Enhance UI/UX with features like dark mode.
- Optimize TypeScript types.
